This is GROMOS++
================

To install the package type

1. mkdir -p config
2. aclocal
3. libtoolize
4. autoconf
5. automake --add-missing
6. ./configure
7. make
8. make install

See ./configure --help for options.

for convenience, the first five steps are in the Config.sh
script:

1. ./Config.sh
2. ./configure
3. make
4. make install

necessary compilation tools
***************************

ANSI C++ compatible compiler
(g++ >= 3.0; tested with gcc version 3.2.3)
GNU autotools:
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.57
libtoolize (GNU libtool) 1.5
automake (GNU automake) 1.7.4

Required libraries
******************

the GNU Scientific Library is required. (GSL)
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
compilation has been checked with version 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3

if the GSL is installed to the default location ./configure
will usually be able to find it.
Otherwise set the compilation flags accordingly.

Assume GSL is installed to /home/foo/libraries/gsl.
the directorie structure would look something like this:
/home/foo/libraries/gsl
/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include
/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include/gsl
/home/foo/libraries/gsl/lib

Then the correct compilation flags would be
CPPFLAGS: -I/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include
CXXFLAGS: -I/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include
LDFLAGS:  -L/home/foo/libraries/gsl/lib

to set the flags with tcsh do:
setenv CPPFLAGS '-I/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include'
setenv CXXFLAGS '-I/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include'
setenv LDFLAGS  '-L/home/foo/libraries/gsl/lib'

if you use bash, do:
export CPPFLAGS='-I/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include'
export CXXFLAGS='-I/home/foo/libraries/gsl/include'
export LDFLAGS='-L/home/foo/libraries/gsl/lib'


ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENT DETAILS
******************************

igc:
----
	the GSL is installed in
	/usr/local
	but the library resides in /usr/local/lib/64.
	This means that the LDFLAGS has to be adjusted:
	setenv LDFLAGS '-L/usr/local/lib/64'
