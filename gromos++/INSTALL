GROMOS++ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================

necessary compilation tools
***************************

	ANSI C++ compatible compiler
	(g++ >= 3.0; tested for gcc version up to 9.3)
	(Intel C++ Compiler; tested with version 8.1)

Required libraries
******************

	GNU Scientific Library GSL (required)
	-----------------------------------------------------------

	http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
	compilation has been checked with version 2.6. or lower

	if the GSL is installed to the default location ./configure
	will usually be able to find it.
	Otherwise, when running configure in steps A 5. oder B 4. below, 
        set the compilation flags accordingly:

	e.g. ../configure --with-gsl=/path/to/gsl

        FFTW Fast Fourier Transform Library (optional)
        ----------------------------------------------

        if the fftw3 installation directory is not in your standard search
        path for header files and libraries, you can use

        ../configure --with-fftw=/path/to/fftw3

Case A) Installing from a tarball
*********************************

	1. tar zxvf gromos++-x.y.z.tar.gz
	2. cd gromos++-x.y.z
	3. mkdir BUILD
	4. cd BUILD
	5. ../configure
	6. make
	7. make install

	Info:
	  .) See ./configure --help for options.
          .) Step 7 is optional. It will place the programs in BUILD/bin, or in
             the directory specified by --prefix in step 5.
	  .) If you leave out step 7, programs will be in BUILD/program/
             and BUILD/contrib
	  .) You may choose any other name for the BUILD directory or do 
             multiple builds by choosing different directory names by repeating 
             from step 3.

Case B) To compile and install the unconfigured source tree from git
********************************************************************

	prerequisites:
		GNU autotools:
		    autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.58 or newer
		    libtoolize (GNU libtool) 1.5 or newer
		    automake (GNU automake) 1.7.9 or newer

	1. ./Config.sh
	2. mkdir BUILD
	3. cd BUILD
	4. ../configure
	5. make
        6. make install

	Info:
	  .) ./Config.sh is a wrapper of the following commands:
		    1. mkdir -p config
 		    2. aclocal
		    3. libtoolize --copy
		    4. autoconf
		    5. autoheader
		    6. automake --add-missing --copy
	  .) See ./configure --help for options.
          .) Step 6 is optional. It will place the programs in BUILD/bin, or in
             the directory specified by --prefix in step 4.
	  .) If you leave out step 6, programs will be in BUILD/program/
             and BUILD/contrib
	  .) You may choose any other name for the BUILD directory or do 
             multiple builds by choosing different directory names by repeating 
             from step 3.

	
installing online documentation
****************************
        1. make doc
        2. doxygen doc/gromos++.doxy

optional libraries
******************

	MD++ library (optional)

	Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

	--with-gromosxx=/path/to/md++


ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENT DETAILS
******************************

MacOS X (tested on V 10.3.3 Panther):
------------------------------------

	Panther ships with the so-called developertools (http://www.apple.com/macosx/developertools/),
	which include a port of the gcc 3.3. The developertools might not be installed by
	default though, so you should make sure that this is the case
	(e.g. type: 'which gcc'; if you dont get an answer it is not installed).

	Unfortunately, the MacOS version of the libtoolize program (and others) does
	sometimes not work with things you download from GNU and try to
	compile. Therefore, do this:

	1. Download the GNU autoconf, automake and libtool packages
   	   and install them. By default they will be put under /usr/local
   	   which is just fine.
	   (As an alternative you might just want to install the binary
	   packages from FINK (http://fink.sourceforge.net/), 
	   i.e. the port of the Debian APT package tools.
	   You will need to have FINK installed, though).
	2. Set the path to point to /usr/local/bin so that those versions
	   of automake/autoconf/libtool will be used.
	3. Build the distribution as written above.
	4. In case of linking errors when using the gcc port from Apple
	   build the distribution without support for shared libraries
	   (./configure --enable-shared=NO)
   	   If you really need shared library support, it is possible to
   	   first compile and install the regular GCC from the GNU tarball
   	   and use that one to compile gromos++. This has been tested and
   	   works.

MacOS X (V. 10.4.10 Darwin) with gcc 4.0
----------------------------------------
	Similar as above.

	Shared libraries can also be compiled by setting CC=g++ before the
	autoconf / automake / configure commands. (CC is used for linking).
