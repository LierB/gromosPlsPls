SPARC Solaris & GCC
-------------------

/usr/ccs/bin/ld is the linker chosen by default.
However, this linker links /usr/lib/libc.so to the
programmes, and this library does not seem to be 
compatible with the GNU libc. Choose gcc to link.
If you have problems building the shared
libraries, link everything statically by
specifying './configure --enable-shared=no'
before the make process.


1  alias make /usr/local/bin/make
2. setenv LD gcc
3. automake
4. ./configure
5. make
6. make install
