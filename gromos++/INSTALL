SPARC Solaris & GCC
-------------------

/usr/ccs/bin/ld is the linker chosen by default.
However, this linker liks /usr/lib/libc.so to the
programmes, and this library does not seem to be 
compatible with the GNU libc. Choose gcc to link.
There is also a bug in the creation of the shared
libraries. Therefore use the -shared=no option.

1  alias make /usr/local/bin/make
2. setenv LD gcc
3. automake
4. ./configure --enable-shared=no
5. make
6. make install
