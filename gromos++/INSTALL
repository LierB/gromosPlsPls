SPARC Solaris & GCC
-------------------

/usr/ccs/bin/ld is the linker chosen by default.
However, this linker liks /usr/lib/libc.so to the
programmes, and this library does not seem to be 
compatible with the GNU libc. Choose gcc to link.
There is also a bug in the creation of the shared
libraries. Therefore use the -shared=no option.


1. setenv LD gcc
2. ./configure --enable-shared=no
3. make
4. make install
