#### sample input and options for neighbours
#    This program writes out atomic neighbours of specific atoms
#    where neighbours are defined as atoms sharing a plane of their
#    voronoi cell.
#
@topo ex.top
#     topology file
@pbc r
#     periodic boundary conditions -> rectangular
@nsm 1
#     number of solute molecules; if your coordinate file
#     contains more copies of your topology, specify the number here 
#     default is 1
@time 0 0.1
#     the starting time and increment between between frames in
#     trajectory
@cut 0.6
#     only atoms within this distance are considered in the first place
#     usually 0.6 is enough, but a warning is written if seems to be too
#     small
@atoms 1:3-5
#     write out the neighbours for atoms 3 to 5 of molecule 1
#     default is @atoms all
@traj ex.tr
#     trajectory files
@out ex.out
#     the output will be written to the screen and (if specified) to the
#     file ex.out in a specific format. (This can then be read by other
#     programs such as clusmol)
