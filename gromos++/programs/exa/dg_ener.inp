#Dg_ener calculates a free energy change by reading in several output
#        files of the program ener for state A and state B
#
#
@nfiles 4
#   TOTAL number of files to read in
#
@stateA 
   ener_1:34.dat
   ener_1:40.dat
#   list of atomic energies that make up state A
#
@pairA
   pair_tot.dat
#   list of pairwise interactions that are counted double when adding the
#   energies listed under stateA
#
@stateB
   ener_1:42.dat
#   list of atomic energies that make up state B
#
#@pairB
#   list of pairwise interactions that are counted double when adding the
