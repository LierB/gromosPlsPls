#### sample input and options for rdf
#
@topo ex.top
#     topology file
@pbc r
#     periodic boundary conditions -> rectangular
@centre atom 1:45
#     calculate radial distribution function of atom 45 of molecule 1
#     if more atoms match the centre-specification, the results will be
#     averaged for all atoms
#     other options are:
#@centre atom 1:3-24
#     average rdf of atoms 3 to 24 of molecule 1
#@centre atom 1:3-10 1:15-24
#     average rdf of atoms 3 to 10 and 15 to 24 of molecule 1
#@centre type OW
#     average rdf of all atoms with name OW (including solvent)
#@centre type OW OA
#     average rdf of all atoms with name OW or OA (including solvent)
#@centre cog 1:3-10
#     rdf of the centre of geometry defined by atoms 3 to 10 of molecule 1
#@centre cog 1:3-10 1:16-24
#     rdf of the centre of geometry defined by atoms 3 to 10 and 16 to 24
#     of molecule 1
#@centre all
#     average rdf of all solute atoms in topology 
@with type OW
#     atoms to consider, in this case all atoms with name OW (including
#     solvent)
#     other options are also using type, atom or all like with @centre
@nsm 10
#     number of solvent molecules to consider. Specify this only if
#     @centre of @with atoms refer to the solvent
@grid 100
#     number of points to build your distribution with
@cut 3
#     the distribution will be continued from 0 to 3
@traj ex.tr
#     trajectory files
