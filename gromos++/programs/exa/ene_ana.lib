VARIABLES
# Here you can define variables to be calculated by the program ene_ana
# In principal the program refers to all numbers in the energy file according
# to the definition on pages III-56 and further in the gromos manual.
# In addition the program calculates the total mass of your SOLUTE (according
# to the topology) which can be referred to as MASS. BOLTZ refers to the 
# Boltzmann constant (0.00831441). Variable names that have been set before
# can be used in later definitions (Forward declaration is not possible).
#
# Make sure that variables and operators in expressions are always seperated 
# by spaces
#
# The following variable names are set by default, but can be overwritten:
#  totene = ENER[1]
#  totkin = ENER[2]
#  totpot = ENER[9]
#  pressu = VOLPRT[12] * 16.388453
#  boxvol = VOLPRT[8]
#  densit = MASS * 1.66056 / VOLPRT[8]
#
# Example: to calculate the heat of vaporization from a simulation at 300 K
#          One could also define the number of degrees of freedom and calculate
#          the actual temperature at every time step.
TEMP = 300.0 
GASENER = 0
NUMMOL = 512
hvap = GASENER - ENER[8] / NUMMOL + BOLTZ * TEMP
#
# Example: to calculate the total potential energy for the solute
#          Assuming that the solute is taken care of in the first energy
#          group
totcov = ENER[10] + ENER[11] + ENER[12] + ENER[13] + ENER[14] + ENER[15]
       + ENER[16] + ENER[17]
solute = ENERLJ[1] + ENERCL[1] + ENERRF[1] + ENERRC[1]
       + totcov
