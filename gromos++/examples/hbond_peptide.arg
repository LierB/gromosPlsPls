# give a file which specifies which atoms should be used as donor, acceptor, and H, by using their masses
@massfile       mass.file

# in case you dont want to use the default values for standard H-bonds:
# @Hbparas        0.3 140

# also calculate three-centered H-bonds (1 Donor-H and 2 Acceptors) with special geometric parameters:
@threecenter

# specify atoms:
# H-bonds will be calculated between AcceptorAtomsA - DonorAtomsB and AcceptorAtomsB - DonorAtomsA
# no need to specify AcceptorAtomsB and DonorAtomsB in case you only want to monitor H-bonds within molecule 1:

@AcceptorAtomsA 1:a
@DonorAtomsA	1:a

# however, if you wish to get H-bonds between 2 molecules (1 and 2), specify ALSO:
# @AcceptorAtomsB 2:a
# @DonorAtomsB    2:a

# or between 1 and 2 AND within 1:
# @AcceptorAtomsB 1:a 2:a                                           
# @DonorAtomsB    1:a 2:a

# if you specify solvent...
@AcceptorAtomsB s:a
@DonorAtomsB    s:a
# ... you can also monitor solute-solvent-solute bridges between molecule 1 and solvent:
@solventbridges

# if you specified solvent, it might be useful to use the @reducesolvent flag. 
# it reduces the output of any H-bond involving solvent to the number of H-bonds of a single solvent molecule
# just try it out and compare it to a run without this flag :)
@reducesolvent

# use more than 1 cpu (4 in this case)
@cpus 4

# additionally print output sorted by H-bond occurrence. this applies to all H-bonds (standard, 3-centered, and solventbridges)
@sort

# if you want to remove all the many H-bonds that have an occurrence (in %) that is less than the given number
# only show H-bonds >= 1% occurrence:
@higherthan 1

# give trajectories:
