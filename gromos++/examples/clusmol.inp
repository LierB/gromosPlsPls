#### sample input and options for clusmol
#    This program reads in the output file of the program neighbours
#    and prints out information about molecular clusters.
#    Any two molecules that have neighbouring atoms are part of the 
#    same cluster
#
@topo ex.top
#     topology file
@file ex.out
#     the file ex.out was generated by the program neighbours
@print all
#     for all time frames all clusters are printed out
#     default is "@print series" which prints one line for every frame
#     with the number of clusters and clustersizes.
@nsm 1
#     number of solute molecules; if your coordinate file
#     contained more copies of your topology, specify the number here 
#     default is 1
