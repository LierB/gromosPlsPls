@topo ex.top
#   topology
#
@pbc r
#   periodic boundariy conditions: rectangular
#
@atoms 1:7 1:13
#   atom specifier(s), here atoms 34, 40, 41 and 42 of the first
#   molecule are selected
@time 0 0.1
#   starting time and increment per frame
#
@cut 1.4
#   cut-off distance for the interactions, also used as the RF radius
#
@eps 62.0
#   epsilon outside the RF radius, for reaction field
#
@kap 0.0
#   inverse debye screening length, for reaction field
#
#@soft 1:40
#   a list of the atoms that are to be treated as soft atoms
#
@al2 0.3775
#   the value of alpha(LJ)*lambda*lambda to make a soft vdw-interaction
#   if this is 0 (default) there is no soft interaction.
