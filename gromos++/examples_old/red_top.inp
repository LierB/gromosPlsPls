#Redtop reduces a topology to selected molecules and / or atoms
### Topology file 
#
@topo ex.top
#
### Molecules and / or atoms to consider
### a single number means the complete molecule, if followed by
### a colon a range of atoms is expected (no spaces in such atom
### specifiers
#
@mol 1:4-20
#
### other example:
#
#@mol 1:1-40 1:60-100 2
#
### would take atoms 1-40 and 60-100 of the first molecule and all atoms
### of the second molecule in the topology
### NOTE: if you would take @mol 1:1-20 1:22-34 both pieces are
### considered individual molecules, regardless of original interactions 
### between atoms 20 and 22 (angles, exclusions)
